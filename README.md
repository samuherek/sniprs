Command line tool to save your shell history commands for later reference.
---

### Why?
I wanted to get more familiar with command line tools, but I don't use new commands enough to learn them and remember then. Thus, this tool has a few things that solves this prolem:
- You can find and select the command from history
- it will query explanation for the command with chatGPT (TODO)
- It will store this reference in an `.md` file so it can be changed within a text editor (TODO)
- When you have a free time, you can flashcard these commands with command name and then description shown afterwards (TODO)

This way, I can stay in the command line, learn new less common commands and avoid using google. 
Also, I can commit this to git repo for future reference and easy laoding on a different computer.

Additional features:
- Add a command manually without the history search (TODO)
- ...
